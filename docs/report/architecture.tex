Espressifâ€™s ESP8266 highly integrated Wi-Fi SoC solution for efficient power usage, compact design and reliable performance in the Internet of Things industry. The integrated high-speed cache helps to increase the system performance and optimize the system memory. \\
Most importantly, ESP8266 also integrates a 32-bit processor and on-chip SRAM.
It supports UART, SDIO, SPI, I\textsuperscript{2}C, I\textsuperscript{2}S, IR Remote Control protocols for communication purposes.
Also, it has 17 GPIO pins which can be assigned to various functions by programming the appropriate registers.

\section{Arduino UNO}

The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs) and 6 analog inputs. \\ The ATmega328P has 32 KB (with 0.5 KB used for the bootloader). It also has 2 KB of SRAM and 1 KB of EEPROM. The ATmega328 also supports I\textsuperscript{2}C (TWI) and SPI communication.

\section{MPU6050 Gyro-Accelerometer}

The MPU6050 contains a MEMS (Micro-electromechanical System) 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer on the same silicon die together with an on-board Digital Motion Processor. \\ The MPU-6050 has three 16-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) each for digitizing the gyroscope outputs and the accelerometer outputs.
For our application, the connections between MPU6050 Gyro-Accelerometer and the ESP8266 Microcontroller are as follows:
