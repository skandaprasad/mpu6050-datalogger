\chapter{Conclusion}
On the whole, it was a very exciting experience. This provided us the
opportunity to explore areas we were previously unfamiliar with. The work done
so far to come up with a proof-of-concept was successful, however there is a
lot of room for improvement. A few limitations are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Filtering of ``noisy'' movements that can cause false positives
    \item Choosing a proper cloud solution for deploying the database and
        web-app
\end{itemize}

Apart from addressing these limitations, other necessary additions to make this
a viable design are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ability to detect a wider range of activities
    \item Eliminate the host system from the architecture and move its
        functionality to the edge node.
    \item Perform a more thorough analysis of the data and provide greater
        insights and diagnostics to the user.
\end{itemize}
