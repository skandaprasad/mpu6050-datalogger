\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}
Every person who has a desk job unconsciously is seated in an inconvenient
position for a prolonged duration. In the long run, these seating postures
might lead to undesirable health issues such as aches in the back and/or the
neck. Hence, this project aims to observe the posture of a person and notify
the duration of time for which the person was seated in a particular posture.
\\
This is achieved by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Setting up a sensor-interfaced microcontroller to obtain the
        real-time data.
    \item Transmit the collected data points to a database.
    \item Classify the posture with the help of the data collected.
\end{itemize}

The following are the components used for data collection:
\begin{itemize}
    \item MPU6050 Gyro-Accelerometer
    \item Espressif's ESP8266
    \item Arduino UNO Microcontroller
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:datacollect}
\end{figure}

As demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:datacollect}, the module has to be attached
on the back for data collection. This data is also plotted in real-time for
visualization purposes and better interpretation.
